# Hello from the GUADR Team

Hello! This post is an introduction to GUADR - Gonzaga University's Autonomous Delivery Robot system. This is a year-long student-sponsored senior engineering project with the goal of designing a low-cost solution to autonomous delivery for campus environments. Think [starship robotics](https://www.starship.xyz/), but with open-source and education in mind.

### Objectives

1. Create an open-source sidewalk delivery system for a store on Gonzaga's campus.
2. Build an open source logistics platform for tracking and planning deliveries.
3. Learn about state-of-the-art technologies in computer vision, mobile robotics, and controls.

### The Team
The project is divided into two teams - one focused on hardware and another focused software. The hardware team is comprised of two mechanical engineering students, one computer engineering student, and one electrical engineering student. The software team is made up of four computer science students.

### Coming Soon...
